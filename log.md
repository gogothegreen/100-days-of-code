# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Made a plan for the project: Python projects + R projects + Web apps using Odin

**Thoughts:** Starting a project requires some time spent in thinking. Doing someone else's projects is not a very helpful learning experience. Hence, I have to think my own projects, however difficult it is to do so.

### Day 1: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the **Biofetch** project, a tool to retrieve biological information from the web. Wrote functions to get user input and fetch data from Wikipedia. 

**Thoughts:** This was fun and a much better learning experience. Will add other functionality over the next few days, including NCBI, Swissprot, etc. Note to self: The long delay since starting this was due to couple of interviews in between.
