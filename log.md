# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Made a plan for the project: Python projects + R projects + Web apps using Odin

**Thoughts:** Starting a project requires some time spent in thinking. Doing someone else's projects is not a very helpful learning experience. Hence, I have to think my own projects, however difficult it is to do so.

### Day 1: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the **Biofetch** project, a tool to retrieve biological information from the web. Wrote functions to get user input and fetch data from Wikipedia. 

**Thoughts:** This was fun and a much better learning experience. Will add other functionality over the next few days, including NCBI, Swissprot, etc. Note to self: The long delay since starting this was due to couple of interviews in between.

### Day 2: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Configured git, generated ssh key and linked it to GitHub, tested that it is working!

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 3: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added the Entrez fetching function working in **Biofetch**

**Thoughts:** This is not working as expected!


### Day 4: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started working on creating HTML files.

**Thoughts:** This was fun and easy.


### Day 5: January 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got the Entrez fetching function working!

**Thoughts:** Error was caused by a typo.

### Day 6: January 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a recipe website in html.

**Thoughts:** It was cool to learn some shortcuts to create html files in VScode.

### Day 8: January 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced R code from the book "Computational Genomics with R"

**Thoughts:** This was basically a revision. I have forgotten many things. Need to keep revising and practising, especially bigger projects.

### Day 9: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did some more R exercises from "Computational Genomics with R".

**Thoughts:** This was a bit more involved. It was easy but tok me time because I have lost familiarity with the syntax.
