# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Made a plan for the project: Python projects + R projects + Web apps using Odin

**Thoughts:** Starting a project requires some time spent in thinking. Doing someone else's projects is not a very helpful learning experience. Hence, I have to think my own projects, however difficult it is to do so.

### Day 1: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the **Biofetch** project, a tool to retrieve biological information from the web. Wrote functions to get user input and fetch data from Wikipedia. 

**Thoughts:** This was fun and a much better learning experience. Will add other functionality over the next few days, including NCBI, Swissprot, etc. Note to self: The long delay since starting this was due to couple of interviews in between.

### Day 2: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Configured git, generated ssh key and linked it to GitHub, tested that it is working!

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 3: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added the Entrez fetching function working in **Biofetch**

**Thoughts:** This is not working as expected!


### Day 4: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started working on creating HTML files.

**Thoughts:** This was fun and easy.


### Day 5: January 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Got the Entrez fetching function working!

**Thoughts:** Error was caused by a typo.

### Day 6: January 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a recipe website in html.

**Thoughts:** It was cool to learn some shortcuts to create html files in VScode.

### Day 8: January 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced R code from the book "Computational Genomics with R"

**Thoughts:** This was basically a revision. I have forgotten many things. Need to keep revising and practising, especially bigger projects.

### Day 9: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 1. Did some more R exercises from "Computational Genomics with R". 2. Published a markdown page GitHub pages, rendered as a static site by Jekyll. Next step is to create a personal website + blog hosted from my Github.

**Thoughts:** 1. This was a bit more involved. It was easy but took me time because I have lost familiarity with the syntax. 2. This was fun to get it working.

### Day 10: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS basics. Did some more R exercises.

**Thoughts:** CSS was easy to understand. It was much more fun, not much syntax troubles with R.

### Day 11: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a web-scrapper in Python using [online instructions](https://practicalpython.yasoob.me/chapter2.html). 

**Thoughts:** Should do many more projects to get better with Python. Need to read up more on the modules used.

### Day 12: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a personal website and blog on GitHub using Jekyll.

**Thoughts:** This was very simple. I could have done this already in 2014!

### Day 13: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started working on creating a blog comparing skills required for bioinformatics vs datascience. Using Python for this.

**Thoughts:** Initially tried scraping the info from job portals like Indeed, hnowever this seems not so straight forward. This is because all job sites have jobs in a two column format, with job listings on the left and their corresponding expanded descriptions on the right. I don't know hoe to scrape this info.

### Day 14: February 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to manually get the job requirements at this stage. Scraping can be added later. Developed analysis code in Python.

**Thoughts:** Needed to check correct Python syntax many times, however it was straightforward. Had fun experimenting with the code.

### Day 15: February 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Decided to do the graphics in R. Modified the Python code by putting stuff in functions. Put it all together and wrote the blog. Uploaded the code to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** I had forgotten a lot of R syntax. Should remember to brushup often.
